Developing a process scheduling and memory management simulator in C can be an insightful but challenging task. Here are some common problems and challenges you might face:

üß† Conceptual Challenges
1. Understanding Scheduling Algorithms
Correctly implementing FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority scheduling requires a solid grasp of:

Arrival time vs execution time

Preemptive vs non-preemptive scheduling

Fair time slicing (for Round Robin)

2. Handling Ties and Edge Cases
When multiple processes have the same arrival time, priority, or burst time, how do you decide which runs first?

How do you handle a process arriving mid-schedule (especially for RR and SJF)?

üßÆ Logical & Algorithmic Challenges
3. Accurate Time Tracking
It's easy to make mistakes updating:

current_time

start_time, completion_time

waiting_time, turnaround_time

Errors here will cause incorrect metric calculations.

4. Round Robin Complexity
Simulating time slices and queue rotations involves:

Accurately managing the ready queue

Keeping track of remaining_time

Switching processes at the right moment

5. Sorting and Selection
You often need to sort or select from processes based on burst time, priority, or arrival time.

Sorting dynamically during runtime can be tricky and inefficient if not done well.

üßµ Memory Management Challenges
6. Simulating Dynamic Memory Allocation
You need to simulate memory usage for each process without using real dynamic memory (malloc), which may require:

Tracking allocated vs available memory

Preventing overallocation

Skipping or queueing processes if memory isn‚Äôt available

7. Memory Leaks or Incorrect Accounting
Failing to ‚Äúdeallocate‚Äù memory after process completion can result in inaccurate simulation.

Allocating memory to a process that‚Äôs already terminated or lacks burst time is another frequent bug.

üîÑ State & Data Management Challenges
8. Managing Process States
Properly updating states (New, Running, Terminated) is important for:

Logging

Debugging

Scheduling logic

9. Resetting Between Schedulers
When testing multiple schedulers in one run, you must reset:

Memory usage

Process times and states

Metrics (waiting/turnaround time)

üêõ Debugging & Testing Issues
10. Hidden Bugs in Time Calculation
Logic bugs may go unnoticed if:

Output format is unclear

You don't test with varied and complex process inputs

11. Lack of Input Validation
Hardcoded or invalid inputs (e.g., negative burst time) can crash the program or yield meaningless results.

üñ•Ô∏è User Experience Challenges
12. Poor Output Formatting
Without clear console formatting, the scheduling output becomes hard to read and debug.

13. No Visualization
Pure text output makes it hard to visualize process order, time slices, memory usage, etc.

‚úÖ Best Practices to Overcome These Challenges
Use structs efficiently to store all process data.

Modularize each scheduling algorithm into its own function.

Write helper functions for memory allocation, deallocation, and state reset.

Test with edge cases: simultaneous arrivals, large memory requests, zero burst time.

Include debug print statements (optional toggle) to trace execution.
